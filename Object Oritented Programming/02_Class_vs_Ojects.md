# 🧠 Class vs Object – Key Concepts

## 🧱 Object
- Anything in the world.
- Defined by:
  - **🔑 Properties** (attributes)
  - **⚙️ Behavior** (functions)
- **📺 Example: Television**
  - Properties: 📏 Width, 📐 Height, 🎨 Color, 🧱 Material
  - Behavior: 🔘 Turn on/off, 🔄 Change channel

## 🏗️ Class
- Blueprint or template to create objects.
- Defines properties and behaviors but is not a real entity itself.
- **🖼️ Example: General template for televisions**

## 🧬 Object is an Instance of a Class
- Creating an object from a class is called **🛠️ Instantiation**.

## 🛣️ Real-Life Analogy
- **📐 Class**: Car design
- **🚗 Object**: Actual car built using that design
