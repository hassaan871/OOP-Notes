# Principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java

## 🧠 Overview
This section introduces the fundamental concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with a focus on Java. The content connects programming principles with real-world scenarios to build intuitive understanding.

---

## 🚀 Key Concepts

### 1. Real-World Relevance
- OOP concepts mirror real-life entities and interactions.
- Examples help visualize how OOP principles relate to daily experiences.

### 2. Class vs Object
- **Class**: A blueprint or template for creating objects.
- **Object**: An instance of a class containing actual values and behavior.

## 🧱 Core Principles of OOP

### 🔍 Abstraction
- Hides internal implementation.
- Shows only essential features to the user.

### 📦 Encapsulation
- Combines data and methods into a single unit (class).
- Protects data by making it private and accessible through public methods.

### 🧬 Inheritance
- Allows one class (subclass) to inherit fields and methods from another (superclass).
- Promotes code reuse and hierarchical classifications.

### 🎭 Polymorphism
- Enables one interface to be used for different data types or functions.
- Methods can behave differently based on the object that is calling them.
